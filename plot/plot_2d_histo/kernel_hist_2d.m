function [f, intgl, x1s, x2s] = kernel_hist_2d(x, gridx1, gridx2, bw, cellarea)
% KSDENSITY2D Compute kernel density estimate in 2D.
% F = KSDENSITY2D(X,GRIDX,GRIDX2,BW) computes a nonparametric estimate of
% the probability density function of the sample in the N-by-2 matrix X.
% f is the vector of density values evaluated at the points in the grid
% defined by the vectors GRIDX1 and GRIDX2. The estimate is based on a
% normal kernel function, using a window parameter (bw) that is
% specified for both the x1 and x2 directions. intgl is the integral of f.
% cellarea is the area of one cell in the grid (used to normalize)
