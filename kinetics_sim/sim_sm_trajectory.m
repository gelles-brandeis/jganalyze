function traj = sim_sm_trajectory(model, max_length)
% sim_sm_trajectory: produces a single reaction trajectory by Gillespie
% simulation of a kinetic model.
% 
% Inputs:
%
%   model.states: column cell array with names of states
%   model.k: rate constant matrix; model.k(i,j) is the rate constant (in 
%       s-1 or min-1 for conversion of state i ==> state j.  All diagonal
%       elements should be zero for a Markov process.  If model.k(i,:) is
%       all zeros, that defines state i as a dead end meaning that entry
%       into state i terminates the trajectory.
%   model.start_prob: column vector; model.start_prob(i) is the probability
%       that a trajectory will start in state i. Elements must be
%       non-negative and sum to 1.
%
%   max_length: terminate the trajectory after this number of steps, if it
%       doesn't stop sooner.
%
% Outputs:
%
%   traj.* are all column vectors of the same length describing the
%   trajectory
%       .no: state number
%       .name: state name
%       .duration: duration in the state
%       .time: cumulative time till the end of state.
